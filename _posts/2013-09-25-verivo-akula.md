The new Akula Cordova SDK is designed to bridge the gap of enterprise capabilities and yes â€“ PhoneGap. Companies can access any back-end system (on-premise or cloud) and enable helpful enterprise features like authentication, single sign-on, authorization rules, added security features, and a centralized control and management of the app. It also tackles the issue of local data storage by employing SQLite databases to overcome these limits in building enterprise-grade apps.
