The NumBox jQuery Plugin, compatible with jQuery Mobile and other frameworks, was originally developed for PhoneGap applications, to help ensure that a numeric keyboard will pop-up on mobile devices when a number is entered. It offers real-time validation as you type plus display formatting for HTML5 input type="number" elements.
