iMAG is a new and innovative service which lets you in an easy, fast and inexpensive way to create your own Application (App) that guides the tourists of your museum along the defined itineraries and provides them with all the necessary information. The App created with iMAG, which is conceived not only for the museums but can be used for all other historical structures or naturalistic itineraries, is a really cheap solution that can replace the old and expensive audio-guides.
