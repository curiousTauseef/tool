The Quicklight project is a collection of libraries that, along with the Saltarelle C# to Javascript compiler, allow a developer to write anything from Rich Internet Applications to Apps for mobile phones using C# and the HTML based Razor syntax. One of the libraries, the Quicklight.Mobile library, contains meta data for the PhoneGap/Cordova library. This allows the developer to write C# code against the PhoneGap/Cordova library, then compile it to Javascript using the Saltarelle compiler.
