If you are writing an app that needs to communicate with a back-end system then these libraries do all the hard work for you. Make a reliable Ajax call that buffers when you are offline and which copes with switching between WiFi and mobile networks. Send data to another named user from a device or from a backend system via a POST to our proxy, with push notifications for all the major platforms done for you.
