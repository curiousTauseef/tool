Handheld Designer is an application for the Mac that makes it easy and fun for anyone to create HTML5 mobile web applications, without learning HTML or CSS (if you don't want to). Build games, productivity and to-do list apps, and more with a simple drag-and-drop editor. And when you're done, share your app with a single click using the built-in web-app hosting, or create a native application by exporting your app as a standard HTML5 web-app suitable for inclusion in a PhoneGap project.
