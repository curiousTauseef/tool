TestFairy helps mobile developers do painless app testing.

When testing mobile apps in the crowd, you never know what exactly was done and if there was a problem, what exactly went wrong on the client side.

TestFairy solves this problem by providing you a video of the exact test that was done, including CPU, Memory, GPS, Network and a lot more.
